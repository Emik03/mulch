A plugin that sculpts and shapes SVs with tweeners for the video game [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver/Quaver).

Originally named `mul` as a shortening of "multiply". However with the inclusion of the ability to add, its name became misleading.

### Features

- Scale selected SVs with a tweener, including support for [all common eases](https://easings.net/).
- Apply the ease over the entire section, or treating each selected note as its own section for maximum convenience.
- Use the keyboard shortcuts (`UIOP`), including swapping `from` and `to`, as well as performing the 3 types of actions.
- Add in-between SVs — also known as smearing — to existing SVs.
- Specify with a toggle to add or multiply to the existing SV.
- Preview the tween with a convenient plot thanks to [Sweetplum](https://github.com/ESV-Sweetplum), to preview how your SVs will be shaped.
- Use the built-in calculator to quickly evaluate expressions, without the need to ever tab out of the game.
- Use that same calculator tool to store reoccuring numbers, by creating as many instances of calculators as you desire.
- Ever had broken displacements? Need to align notes with each other? The measure tool can tell you relative and absolute positioning, with game-accurate precision.
